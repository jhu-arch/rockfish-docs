Linux Commands
==============

You may be familiar with operating systems such as Windows or Mac OS X. GNU/Linux, here called by only Linux, is one such powerful operating system which is pervasive in application and use today.

List directory contents. If you know windows you would know that the command dir is used to list the contents in a directory. In Linux, the ls command is used to list out files and directories. Some versions may support color-coding. The names in blue represent the names of directories.

.. code-block:: console

  [userid@local ~]$ ls -l | less

This helps to paginate the output so you can view page by page. Otherwise the listing scrolls down rapidly. You can always use ``ctrl+c`` to go back to the command line.
